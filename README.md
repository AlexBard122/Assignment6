Task division among members is still being discussed

Tasks:

  1: read reports into treemaps. Outer map has state as key, inner treemap as value. Inner treemap has start date as key, list of accidents on that day as value.
      Note: inner maps value should be an actual list strings which include state and date

  2: provide menu for state & date (Ex: CA 2022-10-20) and calculate the number of accidents on and after that date for that state

  3: create simple diagrams to compare the insertion time and search time for assignment 6 to that of assignment 5.

  4: use diagrams to discuss which data structure works best

  5: create a pdf file to show the runtime for each subtask and its complexity order. Also include diagrams and discussion
